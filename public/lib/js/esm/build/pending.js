/**
 * A helper used to inform Behat that an operation is in progress and that Behat must wait for it to complete.
 *
 * This is useful in cases where the user interface may be updated and take some time to change — for example
 * where applying a transition.
 *
 * This data is used by Behat, but may also be consumed by other locations too.
 *
 * By informing Behat that an action is about to happen, and then that it is complete, allows
 * Behat to wait for that completion and avoid random failures in automated testing.
 *
 * Note: It is recommended that a descriptive key be used to aid in debugging where possible, but this is optional.

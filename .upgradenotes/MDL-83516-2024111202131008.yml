  tool_mfa:
    - message: >-
        The Multi-factor authentication management improvement uses the
        `plugin_management_table`, which means the `managemfa` admin setting is
        no longer necessary. The following files are removed:


        - `admin/tool/mfa/classes/local/admin_setting_managemfa.php`

        - `admin/tool/mfa/tests/admin_setting_managemfa_test.php`
      type: removed
    - message: >-
        The two language strings in the tool_mfa plugin, namely `inputrequired` and `setuprequired`, are deprecated.

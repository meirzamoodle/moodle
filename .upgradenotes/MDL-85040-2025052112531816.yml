notes:
  core:
    - message: >-
        The mustache_pix_helper() `core\output\mustache_pix_helper::pix()` now supports the attributes parameter,
        and the improvement also extends to the JS pixHelper() `lib/amd/src/local/templates/renderer.js`.
        However, for the JS, the attributes coverage is limited to the aria-hidden attribute,
        which can be improved later when needed.
      type: improved
